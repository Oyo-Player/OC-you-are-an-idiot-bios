A little bios inspired by youareanidiot.org<br>
Made by OyoPlayer (minecraft username)</br><br>

## Installation:
<br>To install the bios with OpenOS, run this command (need an internet card):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oyo-Player/OC-you-are-an-idiot-bios/main/eeprom_code.lua /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && flash -q /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && reboot
```
</br>If you don't have an internet card, copy the code and paste it a file and then run this command ([file-name] is the name you gave to the file):
```
flash -p [file-name] && reboot
```

# other things
<br>Also I'm not a very good at programming BIOS, so there will probably be some issues.
<br>There will probably be some updates for some days but I'll not work a lot on this project. This project has been made only for fun.
